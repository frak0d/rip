# üßê What is `rip` ?
#### `rip` is a C++20 Module that aims at making the Standard Library Convenient to Use, so that you can *Rest In Peace*. And also, iostream is optional!!

## Usage :-
```cpp
import rip; // imports everything except rip:vector:stream, because iostream is bloat
import rip:image; // Simple in-memory HTML like canvas, RGB and RGBA variant
import rip:lector; // std::vector extended with useful member functions
import rip:iofile; // modernized cstdio, because fstream is bloat
import rip:vector:stream; // additional functionality using iostreams
```
